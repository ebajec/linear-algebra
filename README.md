# linear-algebra

Some basic linear algebra tools for general use. 

**compile.bat** Compiles and runs main.cpp.

**main.cpp:** This is not a part of the library; it's just for running tests.

**matrix.hpp:** Template (m x n)-matrix class with overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplicaiton, comparison, indexing, and concatenation. Also includes determinants and gaussian elimination, along with most other things one would expect.  Size is **not** dynamic and determined at compile time.
