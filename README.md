# linear-algebra

Some basic linear algebra tools for general use. 

**compile.bat** Compiles and runs main.cpp.

**matrix.hpp:** Template (m x n)-matrix class with overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplicaiton, comparison, indexing, and concatenation. Also includes determinants and gaussian elimination, along with most normal matrix operations.  Size is **not** dynamic and determined at compile time.
