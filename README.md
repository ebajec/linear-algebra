# linear-algebra

Some basic linear algebra tools for general use.  Plan on including matrix operations, inner product/projection stuff, eigen-things, 
some matrix decompositions.  

**compile.bat** Compiles and runs main.cpp.

**matrix.hpp:** Matrix class with overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplicaiton, comparison, and indexing. Also includes determinants and gaussian elimination.  Size is **not** dynamic and determined at compile time.
